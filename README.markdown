bob - the builder
=======

Build test objects easily:

  * specify defaults
  ** tailor defaults within tests at build time with optional hash or block
  * chain builders
  * reuse builder instances to create multiple objects

Why not a use factory?

  * Common for tests to specialise defaults; provide a readable way to accommodate this;
  * Common for a test to need to build several objects of the same type;
